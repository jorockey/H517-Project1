<h4>Design Process</h4>
<p>I began the design process with a rough sketch of the visualization as seen below. This sketch includes the map of London in the top right corner with the timeline graph to the right of it. I initially put these plots on the top of the page because I considered them to be the most essential part of the visualization. Below them I sketched a tree map depicting the deaths of different age groups as well as a pie chart depicting male versus female deaths. I chose these types of plots in my initial sketch because I wanted some variety. I thought it would be benficial to have many different types of visualizations. As I started to write the code for the visualization, I had some different ideas and revised some of my ideas from the sketch. Overall, the visualization went through many different changes as I developed it and saw the results of my code.</p>

<h4>Design Choices</h4>
<p>Now we will discuss the specific design choices and what went into each decision. First, the charts depicting age and gender splits are at the top of the page. I decided on this because these are the more basic exploratory analysis. I wanted viewers to see the more simple plots before the more complicated map and timeline. After, creating the tree map and pie chart similar to the sketch, I decided that these were not the best way to display the information. Ultiimately I determined that bar charts were the best visualization to use. Although this abandons the idea of variety, I think that it was more important to get the information across clearly to the viewer. Furthermore, I also chose to not have a tradition y-axis for these graphs and place the y-value on top of the bars. I did this because the y-axis made it very hard to differentiate the values in the "Death by Gender" graph, as the values are very close to each other. Therefore, I found it best to just display the values outright. Then, it made sense to also not have a y-axis on the "Death by Age" graph because I wanted the two graphs to be visually similar. Finally, for the "Death by Gender" graph, I chose to make the male bar red and the female bar blue. This makes it possible to differentiate between male and female deaths in the map below as we use the same colors.</p>
<p>On the next row of the page, we see the timeline graph and map, along with two sliders to filter the range of days displayed on the map. </p>
